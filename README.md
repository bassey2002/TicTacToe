# TicTacToe
We used TDD (Test Driven Development) in this TicTacToe game by writing failing tests for desired game functionalities, then rewriting the code to make the tests pass and refactoring the code while maintaining passing tests. This approach ensured thorough testing and clear code design throughout the development process.
